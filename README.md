# Zoomgle Cardboard

I had an idea for some kind of escape-room style activity where two people are in adjacent rooms, so they can hear each other but not see each other. The gimmick is that each person is wearing a VR headset and can only see what the _other_ person is seeing, so they need to work together to solve a puzzle.

I don't have any VR headsets and it looks like a lot of them don't even have passthrough cameras, so I thought it'd be cool to set it up to use phones and something like [Google Cardboard](https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/) instead. This is for that.

My actual plans for the escape room itself do not yet exist, so if somebody happens to find this and has ideas for puzzles that'd be cool they should pitch them to me.
